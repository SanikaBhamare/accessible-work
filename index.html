            Information workers use digital collaboration tools for project management, preparing and sharing 
            documents and presentations, and team communication and coordination. People who are blind or have low vision are performing 
            computer-based work at increasing rates, yet only 44% of the 8.1 million visually impaired Americans are employed. 
            While advances in collaboration tools (e.g., shared document editors, video conferencing, and chat platforms) make it possible 
            to work together in new ways and create new career opportunities, these tools remain largely inaccessible for blind workers. More 
            than 2 billion people worldwide use collaboration tools on a monthly basis, yet learning to use them with a screen reader – software 
            blind people use to read and navigate a graphical display – is extremely challenging. For example, collaborative writing tools 
            offer only partial access for screen reader users, making it difficult to understand where other team members are working 
            in a shared document. This project advances AI-augmented collaboration tools and creates a more equitable and inclusive 
            future of work by improving job-related skill development, increasing worker self-efficacy, and providing access to all aspects of 
            teamwork experienced by current and future information workers. This project is grounded in formative research and close 
            partnership with four Disability Service Organizations across Orange County, CA and Chicago, IL that serve as the primary 
            work contexts and both employ visually impaired information workers as well as offer training and placement programs.
